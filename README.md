About
---
This is a mini project for the SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) module. We aim to analyse and predict the Big Mac prices of various countries using economic indicators.

Problem Definition
---
- How are the local Big Mac prices of various countries affected by the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), the average gold price in their country, and the inflation rate as well as the year and country?
- Can we predict the future local Big Mac prices in these countries?

Model Used
---
Multivariate Linear Regression

Conclusion
---
- Year, country, PPP value and exchange rate are good predictors of local Big Mac prices
- Average gold price and inflation rate are bad predictors

What did we learn from this project?
--- 
- One-hot encoding for categorical and continuous variables
- Multivariate linear regression modeling
- Box plots for categorical and continuous variables
- Residual plots
- Prediction using past values of variables
- Collaboration using Github
- Git functions
